# Reverse RPC service
Since the server is the API implemtor and service provider, the **network listening operation is generally created by the server**. The client, on the other hand, is the caller of the API, so it is usually the **client that initiates the connection operation to the server proactively**.  
This network interaction mode often requires a **wide area network IP address that allows public access and is stable** on the server side. Using cloud servers is the mainstream solution now, of course, there are also IDC-hosted physical machines that are gradually being phased out.  
Large cloud service providers can offer a stable network environment, redundant and reliable hardware resources, as well as the ability to flexibly allocate resources. Compared with other solutions, they have the advantage of a "dimensional reduction strike" (excluding special cases). After all, professional matters should be left to professionals to handle.  
Although cloud servers have various advantages, their prices are **relatively high**. Generally speaking, there may be a price difference of more than one order of magnitude compared to the resource cost. However, in order to attract customers, cloud service providers will offer sufficient preferential strategies for new orders from new users. **Renewal of payment is the expensive beginning**.  
Under the all-out offensive of cloud service providers to move everything to the cloud, as the company's business grows, its demand for cloud server resources is increasing. During the business growth period, the company may not care about this cost issue because these costs can be passed on to customers to pay. The higher the cost, the higher the asking price for customers will be. Once a business enters a period of stagnation or decline, the cost of cloud servers may become **a long-term expense that cannot be ignored**. To enable the company to survive longer and discover more other opportunities, many companies have begun to consider the solution of **offline migration from the cloud**.  
Using office computers to replace cloud servers is a common solution for migrating from the cloud. However, generally speaking, office computers mainly have two problems that limit their application scenarios. One is that office computers are usually in a local area network environment and cannot be directly accessed by users. The other is the stability issue of **power outages and network disconnections** at any time (of course, **data security and backup** issues also need to be considered).  
In the actual demands of a company, there are often some requirements that do **not have high demands for the stability** of the network environment, such as various internal management systems, test environment systems, log collection systems, non-real-time feedback computing task systems and other non-core service systems. All these systems can be considered for migration from the cloud.    
After determining which systems can be attempted to be migrated from the cloud, the remaining issue is how to enable the office computers in the local area network to provide services externally, allowing target users to access the services provided by the office computers.  If it is a personal need, you can consider using internal network penetration software.  However, for the company's demands, there is no reason for users to install such software.  Therefore, the **entry point facing users still requires a cloud server**.  
The mainstream solution is to deploy WEB services on office computers and install internal network penetration software, and **install internal network penetration and reverse proxy software** on cloud servers facing users, and forward network data between users and office computers through this cloud server. This solution will **double the bandwidth requirements** of cloud servers, but the main hardware resource demands (such as CPU, memory, hard disk, etc.) are all transferred to idle office computers. Cloud servers **basically only have bandwidth requirements**, which can significantly reduce the cost of cloud servers.  
For scenarios where AutoCSer RPC is used as the network component for interaction between the WEB layer and the business layer, AutoCSer provides **reverse RPC service** functionality.  By simply modifying the creation codes of the server and the client, it is easy to switch between migrating to the cloud and migrating from the cloud solutions.  Cloud servers connect to office computers through full-duplex RPC that supports high concurrency and high throughput.  Compared with mainstream solutions, this can further significantly reduce the bandwidth, CPU and other resource requirements of cloud servers.
# Create the reverse RPC server
The following takes the interface symmetry API as an example to illustrate the differences between the two service models at the code level.
## 1. Define the service interface
The operation of [defining the service interface](https://github.com/AutoCSer/AutoCSer2/blob/main/Document/11.ReverseServer/ISymmetryService.cs) is the same as that of a normal RPC service.
``` csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Interface symmetry API interface definition
    /// </summary>
    [AutoCSer.Net.CommandServerControllerInterface]
    public partial interface ISymmetryService
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Asynchronous API Definition
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="left"></param>
        /// <param name="right"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        Task<int> AddAsync(int left, int right);
        /// <summary>
        /// Synchronous API definition (It is not recommended to define the synchronous API in interface symmetric services, as the client synchronous blocking mode may cause performance bottlenecks)
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="left"></param>
        /// <param name="right"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        int Add(int left, int right);
    }
```
## 2. Implement the service interface
The operation of [implementing the service interface](https://github.com/AutoCSer/AutoCSer2/blob/main/Document/11.ReverseServer/SymmetryService.cs) is the same as that of a normal RPC service.
``` csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Interface symmetry API implementation
    /// </summary>
    internal sealed class SymmetryService : ISymmetryService
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Asynchronous API implementation
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="left"></param>
        /// <param name="right"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        Task<int> ISymmetryService.AddAsync(int left, int right) { return Task.FromResult(left + right); }
        /// <summary>
        /// Synchronous API implementation (It is not recommended to define the synchronous API in interface symmetric services, as the client synchronous blocking mode may cause performance bottlenecks)
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="left"></param>
        /// <param name="right"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public int Add(int left, int right) { return left + right; }
    }
```
## 3. Create the reverse RPC server
A regular RPC service requires the server to create a service listener, while a reverse RPC service is created by the client (cloud server), and the **server (office computer) initiates a connection to the client (cloud server)**. In the example, a [simple](https://github.com/AutoCSer/AutoCSer2/blob/main/Document/11.ReverseServer/CommandReverseServer.cs) reverse verification mechanism is added.
``` csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Reverse RPC server (initiating connection end)
    /// </summary>
    internal static class CommandReverseServer
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Reverse RPC server singleton
        /// </summary>
        internal static readonly AutoCSer.Net.CommandReverseClient CommandReverseClient = new AutoCSer.Net.CommandListenerBuilder(2)
            .Append<AutoCSer.CommandService.ITimestampVerifyReverseService<string>>(new AutoCSer.CommandService.TimestampVerifyReverseService<string>(AutoCSer.TestCase.Common.Config.TimestampVerifyString))
            .Append<ISymmetryService>(new SymmetryService())
            .CreateCommandListener(new AutoCSer.Net.CommandReverseClientConfig { Host = new AutoCSer.Net.HostEndPoint((ushort)AutoCSer.TestCase.Common.CommandServerPortEnum.Document) });
    }
```
# Create the reverse RPC client
## 1. Define the RPC client instance
Due to the addition of a simple reverse verification mechanism in the example, it is necessary to [explicitly define the RPC client instance](https://github.com/AutoCSer/AutoCSer2/blob/main/Document/11.ReverseServer/CommandClientSocketEvent.cs).
``` csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// RPC client instance
    /// </summary>
    internal sealed class CommandClientSocketEvent : AutoCSer.CommandService.TimestampVerifyReverseServiceCommandClientSocketEvent<CommandClientSocketEvent>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Reverse service authentication client interface based on incremental login timestamp verification
        /// </summary>
        [AllowNull]
        public AutoCSer.CommandService.ITimestampVerifyReverseServiceClientController<string> TimestampVerifyReverseClient { get; private set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// The client defines an asymmetric test interface (socket context binding the server)
        /// </summary>
        [AllowNull]
        public ISymmetryService SymmetryClient { get; private set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// The set of parameters for creating the client controller is used to create the client controller object during the initialization of the client socket, and also to automatically bind the controller properties based on the interface type of the client controller after the client socket passes the service authentication API
        /// </summary>
        public override IEnumerable<AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientControllerCreatorParameter> ControllerCreatorParameters
        {
            get
            {
                yield return new AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientControllerCreatorParameter(typeof(AutoCSer.CommandService.ITimestampVerifyReverseService<string>), typeof(AutoCSer.CommandService.ITimestampVerifyReverseServiceClientController<string>));
                yield return new AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientControllerCreatorParameter(typeof(ISymmetryService));
            }
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// RPC client instance
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="client">Command client</param>
        public CommandClientSocketEvent(AutoCSer.Net.CommandClient client) : base(client) { }
        /// <summary>
        /// The reverse command server client listens for the authentication socket
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="socket"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public override Task<bool> CallVerify(AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientSocket socket)
        {
            return callVerify(socket, AutoCSer.TestCase.Common.Config.TimestampVerifyString);
        }
    }
```
## 2. Create the reverse RPC client
The [client (cloud server) creation of a listener](https://github.com/AutoCSer/AutoCSer2/blob/main/Document/11.ReverseServer/CommandClientSocketEvent.cs) **only supports the singleton mode**, meaning that only one server (office computer) node is allowed to initiate a connection.
``` csharp
        /// <summary>
        /// Client listener singleton
        /// </summary>
        public static readonly AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientSocketEventCache<CommandClientSocketEvent> CommandClient = AutoCSer.Net.CommandClientSocketEventCache<CommandClientSocketEvent>.Create(new AutoCSer.Net.CommandReverseListenerConfig
        {
            Host = new AutoCSer.Net.HostEndPoint((ushort)AutoCSer.TestCase.Common.CommandServerPortEnum.Document),
            GetSocketEventDelegate = (client) => new CommandClientSocketEvent(client)
        });
        /// <summary>
        /// The client test
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public static async Task Test()
        {
            var client = await CommandClientSocketEvent.CommandClient.SocketEvent.Wait();
            if (client != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"2 + 3 = {await client.SymmetryClient.AddAsync(2, 3)}");
                Console.WriteLine($"1 + 2 = {client.SymmetryClient.Add(1, 2)}");
            }
        }
```
